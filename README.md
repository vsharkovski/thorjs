# ThorJS

This repository contains the ThorJS browser-side implementation.

Everything is built on top of [Thorium](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium).

All work is done on the [`thorjs`](https://github.com/vsharkovski/thorjs/tree/thorjs) branch. The main point of interest is the `thorzeel` directory.
